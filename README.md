# UPE-Coding-Challenge
Worked on with Ellen Mei fellow inductee and friend :) 

Coding challenge for UCLA UPE Induction in Fall 2018. https://gist.github.com/austinguo550/381d5e30d825b90900ef60fa39a806f4

To build and run file: 

This code is written in Java using Maven and requires that you have the Maven library downloaded as well as the Java Development Kit (JDK). (Make sure you set your PATH system variable to include the Maven bin directory.)

In your Java Development Environment, set up your run configuration to build with Maven, with goals [clean install]

Build with Maven and run as a Java Application. Make sure you are using JDK.

Problems with this current version of code:

Sometimes throws NullPointerException when creating the maze board. Sometimes runs into an infinite loop instead of finishing the game. In general, while the code can solve mazes, the code cannot actually finish the game, although in many cases it comes very close.
